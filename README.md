# Arcanoid
A classic Arkanoid-like 2D game made with C++ and SFML framework.

> ⚠ After successful build, before running the game, include SFML 2.5.1 DLLs in executable's directory!

**🧱 Customizing levels:**
Now game consists of several levels that can be easily created and modified. File named `levels.dat`  in `assets` directory allows you to create new levels block arrangement. Letters stand for blocks colors (e.g. `M` stands for magenta) and `.` means empty space. Lines preceded by `#` are comments and are ignored. **Important:** in order to parse successfully, last line of data has to be a comment.

**🎮 Controls:**
Move paddle with `[A]`/`[D]` or `[<-]`/`[->]` keys, restart after win or lose with `[Space]` key, ragequit from the game anytime using `[Esc]` 😁

## 🧠 Development ideas
- [x] current score and top score displays
- [ ] game difficulty levels – differing in ball velocity, paddle size etc., hardcore multi-ball mode,
- [ ] "achievements" / "bonuses" feature – e.g. showing some texts on block crushing passas, and so on…
