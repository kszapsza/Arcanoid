To run the game successfully, including SFML's DLLs in executable's directory seems required (see `/dlls` directory).

## Development ideas
- [ ] game difficulty levels – differing in ball velocity, paddle size etc., hardcore multi-ball mode,
- [ ] "achievements" / "bonuses" feature – e.g. showing some texts on block crushing passas etc.,
- [ ] current score and top score displays, and so on…
